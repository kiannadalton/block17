const pet = {
  name: "Thor",
  type: "cat",
  sound: "meow",
};

// ðŸ‘‰ STEP 1: Add a method to the pet object called `hello` that logs 'Thor says hello' to the console

//ðŸ‘‰ STEP 2: Add a method to the pet object called `makeSound` that logs what sound the pet makes

//ðŸ‘‰ STEP 3: Rewrite the pet object as a class
//  hints:
//       - the constructor will have the same properities as the pet object above
//       - make sure to include the `makeSound` method as well

//ðŸ‘‰ STEP 4: Create 2 pets using the Pet class and call the `makeSound` method for both
