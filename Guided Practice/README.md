# Block 17: Guided Practice

## Steps

1. Create an HTML page named sentence.html and a JavaScript file named sentence.js. Have the sentence.html contain a script tag for the sentence.js file.
2. Create a class named Sentence
3. Add a constructor that takes a parameter named data, which sets the this.data property for an instance of a sentence
4. Use the window.prompt to get some data that you can use to create a sentence
5. Add a method to the Sentence class that counts the number of words in your sentence
6. Add a method to the Sentence class called hasLetter, which takes a letter and returns true or false if the letter is in your sentence
7. Add a method to the Sentence class that takes a letter and returns the number of times that letter is in the sentence.
8. Add a method to the Sentence class called stats. It will return an object with a key for each word in your sentence and a value for how many times the word appears. Example: For 'foo bar bar' it would return an object with keys, 'foo' and 'bar' with values 1 and 2 respectively.
